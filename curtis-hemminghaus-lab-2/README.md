This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

For how I want my website to look like, I want it to essentially be like the first lab, but instead of having my data locally saved, I want my data to be on strapi, and accessed through API interaction. I want to either have 2 collections (Games I have played, and my favorite games) or have 1 collection with favouriteGames being a boolean that will separate the 2 pages. I also want the navbar from the first lab to instead be like the one we did in class as I like the look of it more than my first one. I also, like my first lab, have pagination and a layout for my website.
